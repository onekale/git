        <h5>Ethiopia/amhara region</h5>
        <p>The rock-hewn churches of Lalibela, Ethiopia in the northern highlands of the country must be one of Africa’s finest sights. Steeped in mystery and history, Lalibela and its churches are something that you must see when you go to Ethiopia. Lalibela is not just another Unesco Heritage site that turned into a museum.

          This small town up in the Lasta mountains is one of the country’s holiest places and the centre of
          pilgrimage of the Ethiopian Orthodox Christians. These ancient churches are alive and to visit Lalibela, 
          Ethiopia is to travel back to the times of Genesis. </p>

        <h2 id="">SOF OMAR </h2>
        <h5>Ethiopia/Harare region</h5>
        <p>Holqa Sof Omar: is one of the most spectacular and extensive underground caverns in the world: the Sof Omar cave system. Formed by the Weib River as it changed its course in the distant past and carved a new channel through limestone foothills, the Sof Omar cave system is an extraordinary natural phenomenon of breathtaking beauty.

          Here the Weib River vanishes into this giant underground world with its arched portals, high eroded ceilings, and deep, vaulted echoing chambers. These caves, now an important Islamic shrine named after the saintly Sheik Sof Omar Ahmed, who took refuge here many centuries ago (around early 11th century AD), have a religious history that predates the arrival of the Muslims in Bale — a history calibrated in thousands, not hundreds, of years.

        <h5>Ethiopia/Tigray region</h5>
        <p>The ruins of the ancient city of Aksum are found close to Ethiopia's northern border. They mark the location of the heart of ancient Ethiopia, when the Kingdom of Aksum was the most powerful state between the Eastern Roman Empire and Persia. The massive ruins, dating from between the 1st and the 13th century A.D., include monolithic obelisks, giant stelae, royal tombs and the ruins of ancient castles. Long after its political decline in the 10th century, Ethiopian emperors continued to be crowned in Aksum.</p>

        <h5>Ethiopia/Amhara region</h5>
        <p>Massive erosion over the years on the Ethiopian plateau has created one of the most spectacular landscapes in the world, with jagged mountain peaks, deep valleys and sharp precipices dropping some 1,500 m. The park is home to some extremely rare animals such as the Gelada baboon, the Simien fox and the Walia ibex, a goat found nowhere else in the world.</p>

        <h5>Ethiopia/Afar region</h5>
        <p>Positioned on the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea is the Danakil Depression. Its officially one of driest and hottest places on Earth.With temperatures that often reach 50+ degrees, it’s easy to see why.  This is a surreal piece of real estate that’s strewn with active volcanoes, salted basins, hot springs, and a lava lake all of which combine to create a very lunar-like landscape.</p>
